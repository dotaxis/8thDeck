# 8thDeck
Installer &amp; launcher for Junction VIII on SteamOS and other Linux distros

<br>

## Purpose
This script will:
* Apply patches to FF8's proton prefix to accomodate Junction VIII
* Install Junction VIII to a folder of your choosing (you must create this directory beforehand)
* Add Junction VIII to Steam and the KDE Launcher using a custom wrapper
* (SteamOS Only) Add a custom controller config, so you can control the mouse with the trackpad without holding down the STEAM button

<br>

## Requirements
* A fresh installation of FF8 via Steam

<br>

## Prerequisites

### Pop!_OS
**If you are running Pop!_OS**, `gawk` needs to be installed or you will encounter a syntax error when 8thDeck tries to detect FF8's installation.
1. Open the terminal and run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install gawk
```
**If you are not running Pop!_OS** or don't know what that means, you can skip installing `gawk`.

<br>

## Usage
1. Download and extract to a folder of your choosing
2. Run install.sh (Right-click -> Run in Konsole)
3. Launch Junction VIII from Steam or Desktop Shortcut
